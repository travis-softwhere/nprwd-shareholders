# Production Security Checklist

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the application and provides guidance for secure deployment in production environments.

## Critical Security Fixes

### ✅ TLS Certificate Verification

- The `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` setting has been removed to ensure proper TLS certificate verification
- For development environments, a warning is logged instead of disabling verification
- **Production Action Required**: Ensure valid SSL certificates are configured for all services

### ✅ Secure Logging Implementation

- All `console.log` and `console.error` statements have been replaced with structured logging
- Sensitive data such as user details, tokens, passwords, and request bodies are no longer logged
- Logs now use appropriate log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR) and structured formats

## Production Environment Setup

### Authentication & Authorization

- Keycloak integration is properly configured for secure authentication
- Role-based access control is implemented
- **Production Action Required**: Review and configure Keycloak security settings appropriate for production

### Data Protection

- Sensitive data is not logged
- **Production Action Required**: Enable database encryption at rest if storing PII
- **Production Action Required**: Configure backup and disaster recovery with appropriate security measures

### API Security

- API routes validate authentication and authorization
- Request validation is implemented for all endpoints
- Error responses do not expose system details

## Deployment Checklist

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set `NODE_ENV=production`
   - Ensure all secrets are properly set and secured
   - Remove any debug flags or settings

2. **TLS/SSL**:
   - Configure valid, trusted SSL certificates for all public endpoints
   - Enable HTTPS for all communication
   - Set appropriate security headers

3. **Logging & Monitoring**:
   - Configure log storage and rotation
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
   - Implement monitoring for unusual traffic patterns

4. **Access Control**:
   - Restrict access to logs containing operational data
   - Implement proper network security (firewalls, etc.)
   - Ensure database access is properly secured

5. **Regular Maintenance**:
   - Implement a schedule for security updates
   - Regularly audit user access and permissions
   - Monitor for outdated dependencies and update as needed

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Identify and isolate affected systems
2. Assess the impact and scope of the breach
3. Notify appropriate stakeholders
4. Implement mitigation measures
5. Document the incident and response
6. Implement preventative measures to avoid future occurrences
